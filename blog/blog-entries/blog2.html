                                <p class="pt-3">One of the biggest questions that got me stuck in my most recent phone interview was <b>closure</b>. Not the relationship type of closure, but JavaScript closure. I told the interviewer in an act of nervousness that closurse were "inner functions that have access to global variables." That wasn't very... correct. Not at all. In short from what I've found online, closures are <u>functions with preserved data</u>. Let me explain after this code block.</p>
                                <pre class="javascript-code"><code><span class="code-orange">
var</span> addTo = <span class="code-orange">function</span>(passed) {
    <span class="code-orange">var</span> add = <span class="code-orange">function</span>(inner) {
        <span class="code-orange">return</span> passed + inner;
    };
    <span class="code-orange">return</span> add;
};

<span class="code-orange">var</span> addThree = <span class="code-orange">new</span> addTo(<span class="code-red">3</span>);
<span class="code-orange">var</span> addFour = <span class="code-orange">new</span> addTo(<span class="code-red">4</span>);

<span class="code-green">console</span>.dir(addThree); <span class="code-comment">// Closure is 3</span>
<span class="code-green">console</span>.dir(addFour); <span class="code-comment">// Closure is 4</span>

<span class="code-comment">// Closure preserves a value inside of the function
// Closures are functions with preserved data</span>

<span class="code-green">console</span>.log(addThree(<span class="code-red">1</span>));<span class="code-comment"> // Output is 4</span>
<span class="code-green">console</span>.log(addFour(<span class="code-red">1</span>));<span class="code-comment"> // Output is 5</span>
            </code></pre>
                                <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/drewkiimon/bpg8j4vd/">Click here to see code on JSFiddle</a></p>
                                <p>To be demonstrate how it all works, I have the above example. We have a function called <code>addTo</code> that takes in a parameter passed. Then, inside we have an inner function named <code>add</code> that takes in another parameter inner. <code>addTo</code> returns add, and add returns passed + inner. So the entire function relies on add to finish to return the addition of the two numbers.</p>
                                <p>Next, I declare two variables that create a new <code>addTo</code> object that takes in 3, and the other taking in 4 as their parameter. Now if you console.dir instead of console.log, it'll give you a detailed look of the objects. In the Console of Chrome's Developer tools you will see a <var>f add(inner)</var> with a little dropdown arrow next to it. After clicking the dropdown, and you go to <var>[[Scopes]]</var> you'll see a closure dropdown that will show a "3" for your first variable and a "4" for the other. This is demonstrated below.</p>
                                <img src="../images/Capture.PNG" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image">
                                <p>So, the variables we made will always preserve these <var>closures</var>. No matter how many times we console.log(addThree(1)), addThree will always preserve that variable 3. The variable 3 is now a <b>private variable</b> to the object.</p>
                                <p>w3schools defines closures pretty well.</p>
                                <div class="d-block bg-dark text-white p-2">
                                    A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
                                </div>
                                <p class="pt-3">Even though the function is closed, our variables are still holding onto these private variables even though they cannot be directly called, unless you invoke the second inner function.</p>
                                <p>Thanks for reading! I am still learning closurse, and I'm sure I'll evenetually come back and update this once I fully grasp it, but for now this will work. Second entry <span class="font-weight-light">D O N E !</span></p>
