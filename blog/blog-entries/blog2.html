            <p class="pt-3">Welcome to the first entry of my blog on my portfolio / personal website <a href="http://www.andrewpagan.me/" target="_blank">andrewpagan.me</a>! I appreciate you taking the time to look at my blog and hopefully learn something with me. The inspiration for this blog comes from my recent technical phone interview with SoFi in San Francisco. I spent numerous hours sitting on my computer practicing code, watching YouTube tutorials, and anything I could find that would hopefully help my succeed during my phone interview. However, after my phone interview I felt like a felt short. There were things I thought I knew, but it was evident that I <u>knew of it</u>, but not how to <u>apply it</u>. </p>
            <p>Hence this "blog" you might say. Whenever I'm learning something new and need a place to explain it, I'll do it here. If you find anything incorrect, don't be afraid to email me. In the future I'll try to implement a comment system or some system that works with GitHub Pages (how I host my website).</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading! First entry <span class="font-weight-light">D O N E !</span></p>
